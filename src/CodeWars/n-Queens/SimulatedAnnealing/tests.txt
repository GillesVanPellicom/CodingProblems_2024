Performance testing.

    tabulist:
        (n = 4, epoch = 500)
        compared to: default version
        Results:
            iteration count:
                pre  : ±41 iterations
                post : ±26 iterations
                ±36% decrease

            time elapsed:
                pre  : ±70.00 ms
                post : ±200.00 ms
                ±185% performance loss

        (n = 50, epoch = 20)
        compared to: default version
        Results:
            iteration count:
                pre  : ±22500 iterations
                post : ±23000 iterations
                ±36% decrease

            time elapsed:
                pre  : ±17000.00 ms
                post : ±20700.00 ms
                ±21% performance loss

        Conclusion:
            Tabulist is expensive to maintain. Expense is greater than gains.

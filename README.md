# CodingProblems_2024

### Coding problems from LeetCode, Coderwars, etc... <br><br>

Problems are sorted by site and then by name.

Every problem contains the original problem in markdown and my solution(s) with javadoc. Difficulty ratings in the .md
are according to the specific platform.

My favorites from this group are:
- [CodeWars - n-Queens Problem](src/CodeWars/n-Queens)
- [CodeWars - Interactive Interpreter](src/CodeWars/InteractiveInterpreter)
